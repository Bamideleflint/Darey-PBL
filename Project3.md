# **SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK**

### In this project, we are tasked to implement a web solution 
# **SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK** based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

## **MERN = MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + Node.js**

As shown in the illustration above, a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend residing in a server, through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.

Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which grabs data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.

In order to complete this project we will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
